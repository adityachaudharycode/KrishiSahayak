        <h2>Cure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>Preventive Measures</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vaccination: While there isn’t a specific vaccine for chickenpox in poultry, vaccination for avian pox (a related viral infection) can help reduce the severity of related infections.</li>
                    <li>Biosecurity: Practice strict biosecurity to avoid the spread of viral infections. Isolate new or sick birds and disinfect their living spaces and equipment regularly.</li>
                    <li>Avoid Stress: Minimize stress by providing a calm environment, proper nutrition, and adequate space for poultry.</li>
                    <li>Separate Infected Birds: Quarantine infected birds to prevent the virus from spreading to healthy flocks.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h2>Chemical Measures</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Antiviral Medications: Although there are no specific antiviral drugs for chickenpox in poultry, antiviral treatments like interferons may be considered under veterinary supervision to support the immune system.</li>
                    <li>Disinfectants: Use broad-spectrum disinfectants such as iodine-based or phenolic disinfectants to sanitize infected areas, equipment, and bedding.</li>
                    <li>Topical Treatments: Apply antiseptic creams or iodine solutions to help manage lesions or blisters caused by the infection.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h2>Bio-Chemical Methods</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Probiotics: Supplement feed with probiotics (e.g., Lactobacillus species) to improve gut health and strengthen immunity during the recovery phase.</li>
                    <li>Herbal Remedies: Use Garlic and Turmeric in the feed to boost the immune system and reduce inflammation associated with viral infections.</li>
                    <li>Vitamin C: Supplement Vitamin C to strengthen immune responses and speed up recovery from viral infections.</li>
                    <li>Honey and Lemon: Administer a mixture of honey and lemon in water to promote healing and reduce inflammation in affected birds.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h2>Indian Jugaad Methods</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Neem Leaves: Boil Neem leaves and give the water extract to infected birds. Neem has antiviral and antibacterial properties that may help in managing symptoms and boosting immunity.</li>
                    <li>Turmeric and Ginger: Mix turmeric and ginger powder in feed or water to reduce inflammation and fight infection naturally.</li>
                    <li>Aloe Vera Gel: Apply fresh Aloe Vera gel to lesions on the bird’s skin to soothe irritation and promote healing.</li>
                    <li>Cumin and Fenugreek: Prepare a decoction of cumin seeds and fenugreek and give it to birds to support recovery and boost immunity.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
