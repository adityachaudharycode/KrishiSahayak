About:
**untitled4.ipynb** is the ml code.
**myimprovemodel99** is the keras model after training
**app.py**  is the main backend model from here you can deploy the project
**Static** has all css,js files
**template** has all html files

**NOTE:**
The model is trained with very limited reallife data around 2000 datasets those datasets i cant provide here because of my copyright those data are real life datas and i cant publish publicly here
I encrypted the api key so that login page will not work so just use /dash to get to the dashboard after login 
This code is not for public purposes so please respect it i just uploaded due to hackathon 
All rights belongs to me dont use it in your project or any other place but you can run it 
Also the images will be not shown as i was storing images on my local device so you have to change the code slightly to utilise it


datastacks used
Html,CSS,JavaScript for frontend
Python,Flask for backend
tensor flow,CNN for ml model
and a lot ml frameworks
Geolocator for user location
many different libraries of python for pdf generation
Firebase for authentication
Jupyter Notebook for deeplearning/machine learning code
Google widget for translation
Many different pythonÂ libraries



How to use the code:
use git clone
then install all the libraries required you can check on app.py 
move to destination folder 
run python app.py
